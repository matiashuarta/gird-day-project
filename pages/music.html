            <h2 class="fir">Dookie (1994)</h2>
            <p class="fil">Dookie (stylized as dookie) is the third studio album and the major label debut by American
                rock band Green Day, released on February 1, 1994 by Reprise Records. The band's first collaboration
                with producer Rob Cavallo, it was recorded in late 1993 at Fantasy Studios in Berkeley, California.
                Written mostly by frontman Billie Joe Armstrong, the album is heavily based around his personal
                experiences, with themes such as boredom, anxiety, relationships, and sexuality. The album was promoted
                with five singles: "Longview", "Basket Case", a re-recorded version of "Welcome to Paradise" (originally
                on their Kerplunk album), "When I Come Around", and the radio-only "She". "All by Myself" is a hidden
                track performed by drummer Tré Cool.

            <h2 class="fir">Warning (2000)</h2>
            <p class="fil">Warning (stylized as WARNING:) is the sixth studio album by American rock band Green Day,
                released
                on October 3, 2000, by Reprise Records. Building upon its predecessor Nimrod (1997), it eschewed the
                band's trademark sound and incorporated acoustic elements and pop and folk styles. Lyrically, the
                album contains more optimistic and inspirational themes in comparison to the band's earlier
                releases. Warning was also Green Day's first album since Kerplunk (1991) that was not produced by
                Rob Cavallo, although he did have a hand in its production and was credited as executive producer.

            <p class="reveal fade-left">American Idiot is the seventh studio album by American rock band Green Day,
                released on September 21,
                2004, by Reprise Records. The album was produced by Rob Cavallo in collaboration with Green Day, an
                arrangement the group have been using since they signed with a major label.

                Recording sessions for American Idiot were made at Studio 880, in Oakland and Ocean Way Recording in
                Hollywood, both in California, between 2003 and 2004. A concept album, dubbed a "punk rock opera" by the
                band members, American Idiot follows the story of Jesus of Suburbia, a lower-middle-class American
                adolescent anti-hero.</p>

            <h2 class="reveal fade-left">21st Century Breakdown (2009)</h2>
            <p class="reveal fade-left">21st Century Breakdown is the eighth studio album by American rock band Green
                Day, released on May 15,
                2009, through Reprise Records. Green Day commenced work on the record in January 2006 and forty-five
                songs were written by vocalist/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong by October 2007, but the band members did
                not enter studio work until January 2008.

                The album is a rock opera much like their previous album American Idiot (2004). Armstrong has described
                the album as a "snapshot of the era in which we live as we question and try to make sense of the selfish
                manipulation going on around us, whether it be the government, religion, media or frankly any form of
                authority". The singles "Know Your Enemy" and "21 Guns" exemplify the themes of alienation and
                politically motivated anger present in the record.</p>
