                <h1>The Band Members</h1>
                <p>Green Day is an American rock band formed in the East Bay of California in 1987 by lead vocalist and
                    guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, together with bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt. For much of
                    the band's career, they have been a trio with drummer Tré Cool, who replaced John Kiffmeyer in 1990
                    before the recording of the band's second studio album, Kerplunk (1991). Touring guitarist Jason
                    White became a full-time member in 2012, but returned to his touring role in 2016. Before taking its
                    current name in 1989, Green Day was called Sweet Children, and they were part of the late
                    1980s/early 1990s Bay Area punk scene that emerged from the 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley,
                    California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In
                    1994, their major-label debut Dookie, released through Reprise Records, became a breakout success
                    and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Alongside fellow California punk bands Bad
                    Religion, the Offspring, Rancid, and Social Distortion, Green Day is credited with popularizing
                    mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S.</p>

                    He is best known as the lead vocalist, primary songwriter, and lead guitarist of the rock band Green

                <h3>Bass Player</h3>
                <p>Michael Ryan Pritchard (born May 4, 1972), better known by his stage name Mike Dirnt, is an American
                    rock musician who is the co-founder, bassist, backing and occasional lead vocalist, and former
                    guitarist of Green Day. He has also played in several other bands, including the Frustrators. His
                    stage name was originally a nickname that his friends from grade school gave him, as he constantly
                    played "air bass/guitar" and made a "dirnt, dirnt, dirnt" noise while pretending to pluck the
                    strings.</p>

                    band Green Day. He replaced the band's former drummer, John Kiffmeyer, in 1990 as Kiffmeyer felt
                    that he should focus on college. Cool has also played in The Lookouts, Samiam, Dead Mermaids, Bubu
                    and the Brood and the Green Day side projects The Network and the Foxboro Hot Tubs.</p>
